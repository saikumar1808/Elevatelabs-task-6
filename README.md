## üìä Query: Monthly Revenue and Order Volume

This SQL query extracts monthly total revenue and number of unique orders:

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
  SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM online_sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-04-30'
GROUP BY 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date), 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
  order_year, order_month;
